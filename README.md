Decision tree for political parties
I created a decision tree and dataset that predicts whether someone is a member of the Libertarian, Constitutionalist, or Green party based on four basic questions: do individuals have a right to abortion, should the government participate in environmental restoration/protection, should the government enforce stronger regulations of big corporations, and should we have stronger gun control?
